Sex hormone concentrations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are not normalized during 12 weeks of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. OBJECTIVE: Androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and testosterone are markedly lower in postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than in controls. In contrast, compared to controls, serum levels of estrogens are normal or elevated in women with RA. Since tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alters production of these hormones, we investigated changes of these hormones during anti-TNF antibody (anti-TNF) therapy with adalimumab in longstanding RA. METHODS: In this longitudinal anti-TNF therapy study in 13 patients with long-standing RA without prior prednisolone (7 infusions of anti-TNF: Week 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12), we measured serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), androstenedione, DHEA, DHEAS, free testosterone, estrone, and 17ss-estradiol. Levels of these hormones in patients were compared to serum levels of 31 age and sex matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Upon treatment with anti-TNF, there was an impressive decrease of clinical markers of inflammation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum levels of IL-6. Serum levels of DHEAS and free testosterone were markedly lower at baseline in patients compared to controls, but this did not change during anti-TNF therapy. Serum levels of DHEA and 17ss-estradiol were significantly elevated in patients compared to controls, but similarly, anti-TNF therapy did not change initially increased levels. Molar ratios of hormones, which reflect hormone shifts via converting enzymes, showed typical alterations at baseline, but did not change markedly during anti-TNF therapy. CONCLUSION: Longterm therapy with anti-TNF did not change altered serum levels of typical sex hormones in patients with RA, although baseline values were largely different. In patients with RA, this indicates that alterations of sex hormones and altered activity of respective converting enzymes are imprinted for a long-lasting period over at least 12 weeks.

Control of hepatic glycogen metabolism in the rhesus monkey: effect of glucose, insulin, and glucagon administration. The effects of intravenous glucose, insulin and glucagon admininistration on the hepatic glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase systems were assessed in the anesthetized rhesus monkey. Results were correlated with measurements of hepatic cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentrations and plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations. Both glucose and insulin administration promoted significant inactivation of phosphorylase by 1 min, which was followed by more gradual activation of synthase. Neither glucose nor insulin caused significant changes in hepatic cAMP. Marked hyperglucagonemia resulting from insulin-induced hypoglycemia did not cause increases IN in hepatic cAMP, suggesting that the elevated insulin levels possibly inhibited glucagon action on the hepatic adenylate cyclase-cAMP system. Glucagon administration caused large increases in hepatic cAMP and activation of phosphorylase within 1 min, followed by more gradual inactivation of synthase when it had been previously activated by glucose. Concomitant glucose infusion, with resulting increased plasma insulin concentrations, markedly diminished the duration of hepatic cAMP elevations following glucagon adminstration, again suggesting an insulin inhibition of glucagon action on the hepatic adenylate-cAMP system.
